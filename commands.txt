# notes from when I did the initial setup

% set up virtual environment
python3 -m venv playlist-env

% activate venv
source playlist-env/bin/activate

% install spotipy and neccessary dependencies
python3 -m pip install spotipy --upgrade pip

% keys to be used to set environment variables

SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID = 'PUT CLIENT ID HERE'
SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET = 'PUT CLIENT SECRET HERE'
SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI = 'https://localhost:8888/callback'

% redirect uri calls back to once authentication has occurred-
% localhost can have whatever port number you want (ex. 8888); local host is your machine

% client id = identified application working with
% secret code = password for that application
% both of these are needed to authenticate and allow app to log in as me
% to assign these credentials in the environ use export commant in terminal

export SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID=<CLIENT ID>
export SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET=<CLIENT SECRET>

% to test to see if it worked use echo
echo $SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID

% check items in directory to see where you are
ls

% change directory to env
cd playlist-env

% check items in directory to make sure in right place by running ls again

% to run test to make sure if everything is working as it should
python3 spotipy_test.py
